# Exploring the state of the Internet in Various Economies

The goal of this project is to see how the connectivity relates to the economy 
of a particular nation. This is an incomplete analysis, for the time being. For 
now this analysis links the per capita GDP to the internet penetration percentage for a given country.
Here, we see that wealthier countries have larger portions of the population that are connected via the Internet.
In the future, we hope to see what how the economy evolves with technology. How does the "happiness" of people connect with technology?
What about crime and corruption? How is the internet relevant to improving health?
